# Udemy-code-samples
This repository contains the programs I have written in the course of learning ML(machine learning). 
See https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/ for course content.
It contains also code from the courses in deep learning and AI see the following two Udemy links:
https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-az/

This is not content that I have written myself, but it is content that I understand and will apply elsewhere.
